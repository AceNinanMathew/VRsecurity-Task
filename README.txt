# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard

## Overview

The interface provides a straightforward way to handle user data and associated roles, making it easier to manage permissions in a user-friendly environment.

## Features
### User Management
- **Add Users**: Administrators can add new users by providing a username, email, assigning a role, and setting their status.
- **Edit Users**: Update user information easily through an intuitive interface.
